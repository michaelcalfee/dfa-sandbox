# Adobe Illustrator Layers to SVG

> This script will help you export Adobe Illustrator layers to individual SVGs.

The extension prompts the user for an output folder in which each layer will be exported as a properly scaled SVG file named after the layer.

### Adding the script to Adobe Illustrator

* Add the downloaded script, "Layers-to-svg.jsx" to Illustrator's Scripts folder.
	* Mac: In Applications, right click on Adobe Illustrator and "Open" and drop the script in the "Scripts" folder inside "Presets".
	* Win: [still looking. please send a pull request if you know how to do this in windows]

* SVG icons.
